# DSA learning notes and snippets

## How to use values from index file of LeetCode notes?

**Use values to generate links:**  
`https://leetcode.com/problems/{question.titleSlug}/`  
`https://leetcode.com/problems/{question.titleSlug}/submissions/{submissions.id}/`  
`https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/{submissions.id}/`

**Use question ids for search**  
`question.questionFrontendId` is what learner see as a part of question title.  
`question.questionId` is used by LeetCode for technical purpose.  
Both ids can be used for problem search on page: https://leetcode.com/problemset/

**Compare performance of answers by:**  
Time complexity (`submission.t`)  
Space complexity (`submission.s`)  
Runtime duration (`submission.runtime`)  
Memory consumption (`submission.memory`)
