<h2>How to use values from index file of LeetCode notes?</h2>

<p>
    <b>Use values to generate links:</b>
    <br><tt>https://leetcode.com/problems/{question.titleSlug}/</tt>
    <br><tt>https://leetcode.com/problems/{question.titleSlug}/submissions/{submissions.id}/</tt>
    <br><tt>https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/{submissions.id}/</tt>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Use question ids for search</b>
    <br><tt>`question.questionFrontendId`</tt> is what learner see as a part of question title.
    <br><tt>`question.questionId`</tt> is used by LeetCode for technical purpose.
    <br>Both ids can be used for problem search on page: https://leetcode.com/problemset/
</p>

<p>
    <b>Compare performance of answers by:</b>
    <br>Time complexity (<tt>`submission.t`</tt>)
    <br>Space complexity (<tt>`submission.s`</tt>)
    <br>Runtime duration (<tt>`submission.runtime`</tt>)
    <br>Memory consumption (<tt>`submission.memory`</tt>)
</p>
